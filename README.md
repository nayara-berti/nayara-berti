# Hi, I'm Nayara 👋

I'm a **Software Engineering student** with a background in **Occupational Safety**, currently transitioning into the tech world with a clear purpose:

> Build technology that improves workplace safety, efficiency, and sustainability.

I bring together real-world experience from industrial environments and a growing skill set in software development to create practical, human-centered solutions.

## 🌱 My journey

I come from the field — factories, railways, operations, real risks.  
Now, I’m learning how to transform those realities into **digital solutions**.

This profile is my open notebook:
- You’ll see experiments  
- Incomplete ideas  
- Growth over time  
- And real projects evolving  

I believe great technology starts with understanding people and their challenges.
