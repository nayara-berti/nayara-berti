## 🌱 My journey

I come from the field — factories, railways, operations, real risks.  
Now, I’m learning how to transform those realities into **digital solutions**.

This profile is my open notebook:
- You’ll see experiments
- Incomplete ideas
- Growth over time
- And real projects evolving

I believe great technology starts with understanding people and their challenges.
